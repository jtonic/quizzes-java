### Goals of the project:
1. learn advanced parts of the language, say generics issues caused by erasure implementation.
1. learn some not so obvious support in java such as String and Integers constant pools
1. more...

Whenever I find out some quirks, hidden, interested parts of the java language I will contribute to this project for later reference.
Needless to say this will come in handy for an technical interview.
